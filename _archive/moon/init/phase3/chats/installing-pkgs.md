No problem! To install the required packages and run the provided Go code, follow these steps:

1. Install Go: First, make sure you have Go installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, you can download and install it from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Set up your Go workspace: After installing Go, set up a workspace for your Go projects. You can follow the instructions here: https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code.html.

3. Create a new Go project: Create a new folder for your Go project within your Go workspace. For example, you can create a folder called `llm-cli`:

```
mkdir $GOPATH/src/llm-cli
```

4. Add the Go code: Create a new file called `main.go` inside the `llm-cli` folder and paste the provided Go code into it.

5. Install the required packages: Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder (`llm-cli`). Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra
go get -u github.com/manifoldco/promptui
```

6. Build the project: In the terminal, run the following command to build your project:

```bash
go build
```

This command will create an executable file named `llm-cli` (or `llm-cli.exe` on Windows) in the project folder.

7. Run the CLI app: To run the CLI app, execute the generated file in your terminal:

```bash
./llm-cli
```

On Windows:

```bash
llm-cli.exe
```

You should now see the available commands and their descriptions. You can run any command by appending it to the executable, for example:

```bash
./llm-cli init
```

That's it! You've successfully installed the required packages and run the provided Go code.

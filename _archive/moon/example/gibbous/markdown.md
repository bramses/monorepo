Here's an example of how you might add some basic error handling and tests for these classes. 

For the purposes of this example, I'll write the tests using the `unittest` module, which is a part of Python's standard library. I'll also use `subprocess` to simulate what the implementation might look like, although in a real scenario you'd probably want to use something more sophisticated.

```python
import os
import unittest
from typing import List, Dict
import subprocess

class VirtualEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, path: str):
        """
        Initialize a virtual environment.

        :param path: The path to the virtual environment.
        """
        if not os.path.exists(path):
            raise ValueError(f"The provided path '{path}' does not exist.")
        self.path = path

    def get_installed_packages(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """
        Get a dictionary of all packages installed in the virtual environment,
        with package names as keys and versions as values.

        :return: A dictionary of packages and their versions.
        """
        # Implementation here would depend on how you're getting the installed packages.
        # For now, I'm simulating it with a subprocess call to pip freeze.
        try:
            result = subprocess.check_output(['pip', 'freeze'], cwd=self.path)
            packages = dict(line.split('==') for line in result.decode().splitlines())
            return packages
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Error retrieving installed packages: {e}")

# And so on for the other classes...

class TestVirtualEnvironment(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_init_invalid_path(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            VirtualEnvironment("/path/that/does/not/exist")

    def test_get_installed_packages(self):
        env = VirtualEnvironment("/valid/path")  # Replace with a valid path
        packages = env.get_installed_packages()
        self.assertIsInstance(packages, dict)
        for key, value in packages.items():
            self.assertIsInstance(key, str)
            self.assertIsInstance(value, str)

# And so on for the other tests...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In this code, we're using the `unittest` module to define a test case for the `VirtualEnvironment` class. We then define individual test methods for each of the methods in the `VirtualEnvironment` class. Each test method should test a specific functionality or behavior of the method it's testing. For instance, `test_init_invalid_path` tests that the `__init__` method raises a `ValueError` when given an invalid path, and `test_get_installed_packages` tests that `get_installed_packages` returns a dictionary of strings.

Keep in mind that this is a very basic example. In a real scenario, you'd want to add more comprehensive tests, including tests for edge cases and unexpected inputs. You might also want to mock out the subprocess calls to isolate your tests from the actual system state.

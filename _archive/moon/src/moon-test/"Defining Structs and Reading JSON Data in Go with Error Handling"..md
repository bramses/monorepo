This code defines structs `Command` and `Config` along with their fields. The `json` package is used to specify the field name in JSON format. The `ReadConfig()` function accepts a file path, reads the JSON data from the file, and then unmarshals it into a `Config` struct. If there is an error while reading or parsing the file, the function returns an error.

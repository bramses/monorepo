The given code contains the definition of structs `Command` and `Config` and their respective fields. The package `json` is used to define the field name in JSON format. 

Additionally, it includes a function `ReadConfig()` that takes a file path as input, extracts the JSON data from the file, and maps it to the defined `Config` struct. The function returns an error if there is any issue with reading or parsing the file.
